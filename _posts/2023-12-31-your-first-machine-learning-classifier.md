## Build a machine learning classifier with the Titanic Dataset

This post shows you a basic example of building a machine learning classifier using the Titanic dataset.

The Titanic dataset is a very well known dataset in data science and it contains the name of the passengers
that were on board of the Titanic when it sank. 

We want to predict how likely it is that a passenger survived the accident based on some data like travel class, age
and gender.
